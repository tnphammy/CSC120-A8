Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    * Constructors:
        - House.java: Overloaded constructor with nFloor, hasElevator, and hasDiningRoom only because I thought these where the most important elements of a House for interaction.
        - Library.java: Overloaded constructor with nFloors and hasElevator only due to the same reasons as the one above.

    * Methods (in Cafe.java):
        - sellCoffee(): Overloaded another one that could take a named order, like an Americano.
        - sellCoffees(): Overloaded one that could take multiple (specified) number of coffee orders by the specific requirements, and another that could take a named order in specified quantities, like an Americano.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I used much less ChatGPT this time around, and have been working on this project for days.

    * What worked:
        - Giving youself time to figure out the problems, so start coding early!
        - Mainly trying to figure it out yourself first, then consulting the internet, then maybe ChatGPT (but really refrain from it, unless it's overly specific and it's due soon â€“ preventable by starting early!)
        - For my newly made Coffee.java: Sketching a real-life depiction of a coffee shop and seeing what is a class, a subclass, a list.
        - Looking at old assignments and in-class examples instead of googling. 

    * What didn't work:
        - Feeling bad about not being to solve something: It will happen eventually. To mitigate this, it helps to change your mindset into more of a "I've felt it before, and every time I've come out of it, so I can just let it happen and try my best."
        - Consulting ChatGPT and Google too much: I google, on average, every 5 minutes. And honestly, I don't think it's wrong, as I am still in the beginning stages and I have horrible memory. But now, instead, I try to figure it out by myself for at least 10 minutes, so that the attempts can consolidate certain things in my memory. Now, I google mostly what I don't know (as opposed to things I know, but forgot)
